## Data Pipeline Tutorial

I implemented this project to learn basic data engineering skills.
The project implements a typical data pipeline, involving extracting
source data, cleaning/preparing data, loading data into a data warehouse
(PostgreSQL relational database used as data warehouse) and peforming
a couple of simple analyses.

Technologies used:
- Stitch ETL tool
- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for storing data warehousing data
- Amazon Lambda functions (in bash) for data cleaning scripts
- Amazon Lambda functions (in Python)  for fetching analysis results from RDS database
- Chartjs for rendering charts

## Kalyan Vedala Website

I developed my personal website using Jekyll and github-provided
`minima` theme. I have written a few blog posts describing the process that
I followed to develop this site. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages.
