## Motivation

Once in a while, I find the need to use regular expressions in Python
programs. The regular expressions are usually just one step above what
I might get by using plain string search.

Most of the time, my needs are simple, such as:
- check if a word exists in another string, ignoring case


## Using in a Conditional

```
if 
```

## Search and Replace
